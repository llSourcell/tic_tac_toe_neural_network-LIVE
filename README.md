Tic Tac Toe Neural Network (LIVE)
======


##Overview

This is the code for 'How to Make a Tic Tac Toe Neural Network Easily (LIVE)' by Siraj Raval on Youtube. This code uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of neural networks to play tic tac toe. It is written in pure javascript and uses Web Workers to have multiple neural networks train simulatenously by playing tic tac toe. The neural nets that win a game are given a reward and allowed to 'populate' the next generation via 'reproduction'.

##Dependencies

None. Pure JS.
